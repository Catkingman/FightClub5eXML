				<text>Wolf: Whenever you forgo an attack, you can have the wolf move up to 30 feet and attack a creature. On a hit, the attack deals 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier piercing damage, and the target has disadvantage on its next attack roll.</text>
				<text>	As an action, you can expend a ranger spell slot to infuse the wolf with primal ferocity and have it release a piercing howl. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of the wolf gains 1d6 temporary hit points for a 1st level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each spell level higher than 1st.

				<name>Ranger Conclave: Nightstalker</name>
				<text>The Nightstalker archetype emulates a unique form of shadow magic, used to create shadowy familiars to accompany you in battle. By walking this path, you learn to use your shadow familiar like an extension of yourself, using them like a weapon as you stalk through the dim forests and vast plains of the world, searching for your prey. Your choice of familiar defines your style of fighting, with each familiar playing a different role on the hunt and on the battlefield.</text>

				<name>Shadow Familiar (Nightstalker Conclave)</name>
				<text>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to summon a creature made from shadow magic to serve you. As a bonus action on your turn, you conjure or dismiss your shadow familiar, which takes the form of a spectral creature. You choose the form you can create when you first select this subclass.</text>
				<text>	When you conjure your shadow familiar, it appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. As long as it is conjured, you can forgo one or more of your attacks when you use the Attack action to have your shadow familiar move and make attacks of its own, which use your Ranger spell attack modifier for their attack rolls. Your shadow familiar cannot move farther than 120 feet away from you.</text>
				<text>	The three forms you can choose from are listed below:</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Cat: Whenever you forgo an attack, you can have the cat move up to 30 feet and attack a creature. On a hit, the attack deals 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier slashing damage, and the next attack made against that creature has advantage on the attack roll.</text>
				<text>	As an action, you can expend a ranger spell slot to infuse the cat’s claws with poison and have it leap onto a target within 30 feet of it. That creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Ranger spell save DC or be poisoned until the end of your next turn and take 2d8 poison damage for a 1st level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Raven: Whenever you forgo an attack, you can have the raven fly up to 45 feet and attack a creature. On a hit, the attack deals 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier piercing damage.</text>
				<text>	As an action, you can expend a ranger spell slot to infuse the raven with lightning and have it travel along a line 5 feet wide and 20 feet long. Each creature in that line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 lightning damage for a 1st level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each spell level higher than 1st.</text>
				<text>	 </text>
				<text>Wolf: Whenever you forgo an attack, you can have the wolf move up to 30 feet and attack a creature. On a hit, the attack deals 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier piercing damage, and the target has disadvantage on its next attack roll.</text>
				<text>	As an action, you can expend a ranger spell slot to infuse the wolf with primal ferocity and have it release a piercing howl. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of the wolf gains 1d6 temporary hit points for a 1st level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each spell level higher than 1st. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute.</text>

When a vampire takes particular interest in a mortal being, they may allow that humanoid to have a taste of their blood. This ritual is seldom practiced, and few vampires would ever even dare to try it. But this is not the only way to gain this origin, as many of these sorcerers can trace their powers to a near-death experience with a vampire. Whatever the case, vampiric magic permeates your blood, and your very being.</text>
				<text>	Vampiric sorcerers most often try to hide their ancestry, since their origins can make them as reviled as the vampires that spawned them. However, a select few embrace their vampiric ancestry, and may even seek to become true vampires in death.</text>

		<text>When you cast this spell, you bury a humanoid hand into a patch of loose earth at least 5 feet in diameter to conceal it. The area is nearly undisturbed and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.</text>
		<text>	The hand animates when a medium or smaller creature walks over the area of earth. You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the spell could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the spell, such as those who say a certain password.</text>
		<text>	When the hand animates, it attempts to grab whatever creature triggered it. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained as it is pulled into the earth. When the creature is pulled into the earth, it has total cover and begins suffocating. At the start of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the creature escapes and the hand retracts back into the ground.</text>

		<text>You draw out a portion of your blood, forming it into a rope that you can use to either pull yourself to a location, or pull an object or creature to you. As you cast the spell, you must expend a number of hit points. Then, you immediately send the rope to grab a target that you can see within a range equal to 5 times the number of hit points spent. Once you grab a target, you can either pull yourself to a location within 5 feet of the target, or you can attempt to pull the target to a location within 5 feet of you. In order to pull the target to you, it must weigh less than 100 pounds, and if it is a creature it can make a Strength saving throw to avoid being pulled. If you pull yourself to a target, you move in a straight line towards the target and take opportunity attacks as normal.</text>

Over the next half hour, the blood manipulates itself into a language of your choice, answering your question in the process. The answer is provided using the knowledge of the humanoid that provided the blood, and is answered in less than 25 words. The blood must be from a living humanoid, and needs to be dropped into the book within 30 seconds of it leaving the body. Only one question may be processed by the book at any one time.</text>

			<name>Confusing Gaze</name>
			<text>When a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the shadowtouched and is able to see the shadowtouched's eyes, the shadowtouched can magically force it to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, unless the shadowtouched is incapacitated.</text>
			<text>	On a failed saving throw, the creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during that turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action but uses all its movement to move in a random direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes one melee attack against a random creature, or it does nothing if no creature is within reach.</text>
			<text>	Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the shadowtouched until the start of its next turn. when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the shadowtouched in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</text>
